# This file implements the dynamo optimization for benchmark broadcastAdd on GPU.
# torchdynamo is an internal API that uses a CPython feature called the Frame Evaluation
# API to safely capture PyTorch graphs. Methods that are available externally for PyTorch
# users are surfaced through the torch.compiler namespace.
# which can automatically generate search spaces for optimizing tensor expressions.
